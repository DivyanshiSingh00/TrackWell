# TrackWell
TrackWell is an android app development project that aims to track the health and fitness of the users.
This C++ code is a health and fitness tracking system. It takes user details, calculates daily caloric intake based on gender, recommends a diet plan using a fractional knapsack algorithm, employs graph coloring to suggest items that should not be consumed together, provides health advice based on sugar and cholesterol levels, and optimizes travel routes while estimating calories burnt during the walk.
